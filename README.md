# 🎮 Pong

A 2D game developed using [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) and Lua.  

## 📌 Description
Pong is a classic two-player arcade game that simulates table tennis. Each player controls a paddle on opposite sides of the screen, and the objective is to bounce a ball back and forth without missing it. The game gets faster over time, challenging players to improve their reflexes. This version is recreated using LÖVE2D and Lua as a part of my game development learning journey.
